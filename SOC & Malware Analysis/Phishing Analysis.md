#### Comman phishing social engineering techniques look for in phishing :


#### 1. Authority
- What it means: People are more likely to obey requests from those they perceive as having power or official status.
- Example : “This is the CEO. Urgently wire $50,000 to this account for a confidential acquisition. Do not discuss this with anyone.”

#### 2. Trust
- What it means: Social engineers exploit brand or relationship trust by pretending to be familiar entities.
- An email claims to be from **your bank**, asking you to "verify a suspicious transaction" by clicking a link.
- A fake **vendor or partner** asks for updated payment information or sends an invoice with malicious macros.

#### 3. Intimidation
 - What it means: Creating fear of negative consequences so the victim complies without thinking.
 - Your account has been involved in illegal activity. Failure to respond will result in suspension and legal action.”

#### 4.  Social Proof
- What it means: People look to others' actions or beliefs to decide what’s right — “If others did it, it must be okay.”
- “This software update has been approved and installed by 10 other team members.”

#### 5. Urgency
- What it means: When people feel time pressure, they act quickly — often without thinking critically.
- Your password expires in 1 hour. Click here to reset now or lose access.
- We must transfer the funds within the next 30 minutes to avoid penalties!

#### 6. Scarcity
  - What it means: People fear missing out, so they’re more likely to act when something seems limited or exclusive.
  - “Only the first 100 employees will receive this special bonus gift card — sign up now!”

#### 7. Familiarity
 - What it means: We trust people or things we recognize or are used to seeing.
 - An email comes from a familiar-looking domain:
    `hr@micros0ft-support.com` (notice the typo!)
    or uses the name of a known colleague in the display name.


```bash
"This is your bank's fraud team (Authority/Trust). We detected unauthorized activity on your card. You must act now (Urgency) — click the link below or your account will be locked (Intimidation). Thousands of customers are resolving this the same way (Social Proof).”
```

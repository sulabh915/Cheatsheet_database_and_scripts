#### Common password attacks:

###### Brute force attack :
A hacker tries to access a secure user account through trial and error. This typically involves systematically entering every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols into a password field until one works.==By also using basic logic or publicly available knowledge, attackers can fine-tune brute-force attacks to make much more educated guesses.==

###### Password Spraying :
A password spray attack is a type of brute force attack in which, rather than trying many random passwords against a single account, a hacker tries the same password against many user accounts at once. hackers often employ weak or commonly used passwords (such as "password" or "123456") in their attacks, ==if the one account password is compromise attacker try password in different account or login system==   

###### Credential Stuffing :
Credential stuffing is another brute-force technique. In a credential stuffing attack, hackers use compromised credentials (which they've purchased from the dark web or obtained from a data breach) to log in to other, unrelated user accounts.

 ###### DICTIONARY ATTACK :
  In a dictionary attack, a hacker systematically enters common words and word variations from a specific, preselected list — kind of like a hacker "dictionary." A dictionary attack can be tailored to a specific group or region that a hacker is targeting.
  ==For example, a hacker might use terms and phrases related to local businesses, landmarks, and sports teams when mounting a dictionary attack against a particular company or city==


###### Mask attack :
A mask attack is similar to a dictionary attack, but it's a far more targeted brute-force technique. In a mask attack, ==a hacker analyzes recognizable password creation patterns and/or password hashes they've picked from known data breaches and uses them to apply a filter (or "mask") to their dictionary list of possible passwords.

###### Spidering :
Spidering is also intended to support a dictionary attack and similarly requires some dedicated effort on the part of the hacker. In a spidering attack, a hacker gets to know their intended victim — generally, a larger, more established company — by studying their internal and external communications. This can include social media posts, web content, employee handbooks, product manuals, and even marketing style guides

###### MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MitM) ATTACK :
Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks involve eavesdropping on or otherwise intercepting sensitive communications between the app or website a user is connected to and another, separate platform.  ==In a passive MitM attack, a hacker might create a free, public wifi hotspot, like the kind offered at airports, cafes, and public parks.

###### Rainbow Table Attack :
Rainbow tables are comprehensive directories that use a password hash algorithm to list out every possible plaintext version of an encrypted password.
===In a rainbow table attack, a hacker consults this directory and matches the list of solved password hashes to encrypted passwords they find in a breached database, allowing them to successfully sign in to a user's account.



### **What makes a password easy to hack?**

- Creating weak passwords
- Reusing the same password across different accounts
- Connecting via an insecure network.
- Storing Passwords Unsafely
- **Falling for Phishing Scams or social engineering**
- **Using Default Passwords**
- Not Updating Passwords Regularly
- Ignoring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
